# SomeoneElse-vector-extract

This is Intended to become a set of Tilemaker data extraction rules (see e.g. https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker/blob/master/resources/config-example.json and https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker/blob/master/resources/process-example.lua ) that offer similar data extraction capabilities to https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/SomeoneElse-style/blob/master/style.lua (for raster web maps) or https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/mkgmap_style_ajt/blob/master/transform_03.lua (for mkgmap-built maps for Garmin devices).

Currently it just creates a set of .mbtiles with a fixed name and certain example features in them, for testing the scripts etc. in "SomeoneElse-vector-web-display".

Not yet functional - still very much a work in progress.
